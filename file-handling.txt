File Handling

Modes for text file-
1. r - Read mode - File should exist
read - reads complete data
read(50) - reads specified characters
readline - reads one line at a time
readlines - reads all the lines and put them in a list

2. w - Write mode - File will be created if not found
it starts writing from the beginning, so it deletes all the data in a file and then start writing

3. a - Append mode - File will be created if not found
it starts writing from the end of the file, so it doesn't delete any existing data

4. r+ -> read and write
File should exist
Both of them start from the beginning of the file
Write is not going to delete complete data, it will override only those characters where it wants to write new characters

5. w+ -> write and read
File will be created if not found
Write is going to delete all the data because w+ has priority for writing and that's why rules of write mode are followed

6. a+ -> Same as w+, just that it's not going to modify old data, it will start writing from the end of the file
it's different from append mode because it only supports appending, but a+ supports appending as well as reading also

Binary files (bytes)-
1. rb
2. wb
3. rb+
4. wb+
